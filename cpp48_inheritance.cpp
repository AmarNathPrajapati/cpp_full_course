why inheritance--->
    1.we have to follow DRY principle.(for good pratice)

inheritance-->
    baseClass------->derivedClass

Some important type of inheritance----->

    1.Single inheritance---->
        derived class with only base class.
        employee-->programmer

    2.Multiple inheritance--->
        derived class with more than one base class.
        employee----------->
                            Programmer
        assistant--------->
    
    3.Hierarchical inheritance------> it is another form of single inheritance
        Several derived class from a single base class.
                        programmer
        employee------->
                        Manager

    4.Multilevel inheritance----->
        derived class from already derived class.
        animals ------> mammels----->Cows

    5.Hybrid inheritace-----> 
        hybrid = hierarchical + multiple + multilevel
